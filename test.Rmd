Goal is to try to understand Chapter 3 in Everitt's Introduction to applied Multivariate analysis using R

1. Understand the difference in using covariance matrix Vs Correlation matrix and see how the results vary. Page 66 -68 of the book.

```{r}
 bc <- c(
+  0.290,           
+  0.202,  0.415,       
+ -0.055,  0.285,  0.419,       
+ -0.105, -0.376, -0.521, -0.877,      
+ -0.252, -0.349, -0.441, -0.076,  0.206,
+ -0.229, -0.164, -0.145,  0.023,  0.034,  0.192,
+  0.058, -0.129, -0.076, -0.131,  0.151,  0.077,  0.423)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.
